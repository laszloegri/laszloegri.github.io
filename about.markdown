I’m an AI/ML and computer vision specialist passionate about addressing complex technical challenges. My work spans a range of projects, from developing a deep learning–based exercise recognition system that achieves over 99% accuracy in real-time motion analysis, to designing a reliable fiducial marker system for precise tracking and identification. I have also contributed to advanced sensor calibration and fusion techniques, and explored shape matching methods. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from McGill University, where I specialized in computational complexity theory. I combine rigorous academic research with hands-on algorithm development to create novel solutions for complex problems in AI and computer vision.

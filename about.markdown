I'm a specialist in artificial intelligence and computer vision, and I love tackling challenging problems across diverse fields. For instance, I've recently worked on IMU sensor calibration and explored color science while developing a color fiducial marker system. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from McGill University, where I focused on computational complexity theory. This unique blend of theory and hands-on experience allows me to deliver innovative solutions to complex challenges.
